Learning RPA would definitely add value to your QA career. Lots of lots of organaization are adopting RPA these days, and it will grow in future at a higher pace. Traditional software’s are being automated using RPA tools. Many software integration are also taking place using RPA. At the end of the day RPA workflows and logics are written and configured by a human being only. It automatically adds QA testing scope of a RPA implementation. I have seen QA engineers who used to test traditional software’s are now testing and validating outcome of a RPA implementation. It’s definitely worth learning, you would be able connect the dots quickly if you know how RPA works and you will be able to help your QA engineers and manage their work better. For example learning SQL always helpful for data validation by the QA. Learning a bit of scripting and programming always helps QA engineers to automate their testing using coded UI or sellenium. Similarly learning RPA will give you an edge above others, and you would be able to fluently QA any RPA implementation and communicate better with RPA developers. And please don’t forget to let me know if you could automate your testing using RPA after learning RPA. :)"}]}]
